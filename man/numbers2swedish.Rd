\description{
Converts a number into its corresponding words in Swedish
This is my own adaptation of numbers2words()
I think an even neater solution would be to have an argument
numbers2words(lang = "swe"), but that would require more coding
THIS FUNCTION NEEDS WORK
Cannot return proper grammar: "en miljon" and "ett tusen", or
"en miljon" and "tv√• miljoner", and so on.
