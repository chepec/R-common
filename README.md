# A collection of general functions and data

Includes common numerical functions and some LaTeX-specific functions.

Note that the package is named `common`, despite the repository being name `R-common`.
Sorry about that (this was one of the very first packages I created, and I haven't 
gotten around to fixing the naming mismatch yet).

[This repository is mirrored on my Gitea](https://git.solarchemist.se/taha/common).



## NOTE: the electrochemical reference electrode functions

have **moved** to the [`refelectrodes` package](https://github.com/chepec/refelectrodes)!
