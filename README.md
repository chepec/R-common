# A collection of general functions and data

Includes common numerical functions and some LaTeX-specific functions.

Note that the package is named `common`, despite the repository having a different name.

[This repository is mirrored on my Gitea](https://git.chepec.se/taha/common).



## NOTE: the electrochemical reference electrode functions

have **moved** to the [`refelectrodes` package](https://github.com/chepec/refelectrodes)!
